# Contributing to My Project Assignment

We are excited about your contribution to **My Project Assignment**! Before you begin, please read these guidelines to help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## How to Get Started

1.  **Check the Issues:**
    * Before starting any work, please check the [current issues list](https://github.com/mohamed92100/my-project-assignment/issues) to avoid duplicating efforts.
    * If you have a new feature suggestion or found a bug, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/mohamed92100/my-project-assignment/issues/new) first to discuss it. This helps us coordinate and ensures your work aligns with the project's goals.

2.  **Fork the Repository:**
    * Create your own copy (fork) of this repository on your GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page.

3.  **Clone Your Fork Locally:**
    * After forking, clone your personal copy of the repository to your local machine:
        ```bash
        git clone [https://github.com/mohamed92100/my-project-assignment.git](https://github.com/mohamed92100/my-project-assignment.git)
        cd my-project-assignment
        ```
    * (Note: This URL assumes your forked repository will have the same name in your account.)

4.  **Create a New Branch:**
    * Do not work directly on the `main` branch. Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of your contribution (e.g., `feature/add-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-login-error`).
        ```bash
        git checkout -b your-branch-name
        ```

5.  **Make Your Changes:**
    * Implement your desired changes in the code or documentation.
    * Ensure your changes are tested if applicable.

6.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    * Add your modified files and commit your changes. Write a clear and concise commit message that describes what you've done.
        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Feat: Briefly describe the change you made"
        ```
    * (Use `git add .` to stage all modified files, or `git add <file-name>` to stage specific files).

7.  **Push Your Changes:**
    * Push your new branch with changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
        ```bash
        git push origin your-branch-name
        ```

8.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):**
    * After pushing your changes, go to your forked repository on GitHub. You will often see a prompt to create a pull request.
    * Click on "Compare & pull request".
    * Fill in a detailed description for your pull request. Explain why the changes are necessary and what they accomplish.
    * Submit the pull request.

## What Happens After Submitting a Pull Request?

* Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers.
* We may ask you to make some changes or provide clarifications. Please respond to these comments in a timely manner.
* Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

Thank you for your contribution!
